# React Mini Project

## Build a social network application to view data and social profiles of people you know

## Objectives

- Create an array of social profiles of people you know
- Profile should have a unique id, name, email, avatar, and links to social network of these people
- Create a child component called Card and re-use it for rendering the social profile
- Iterate over the array and for each profile render the Card component and pass user data as props
- Conditionally show the data that exist for the user and handle cases where the data is null or does not exist
- Clicking on any social link for a user should open that link in a new tab
- Use logical AND (&&) and OR (||) for conditional rendering
- Use event listeners and toggle classes for adding dynamic behaviour

Try to build this single page application by yourself using previous knowledge learnt in the React course. Check hints and code for complete solution.
